# subtitle-search

A reading-first viewer for Zoom transcripts. The text is the document; the
recording is a reference you drop into when you need to hear how something was
said. Point it at a recording folder, read, pull quotes.

```bash
uv sync                                  # exact versions from uv.lock
uv run subtitle-search /path/to/folder
```

Or with pip, if you would rather not add a tool:

```bash
pip install -e .
subtitle-search /path/to/recording-folder
```

It opens `http://127.0.0.1:8765`.

## The workflow

**Download → anonymize → analyze.** Three steps, and the middle one is why the
folder layout matters: the anonymizer is told exactly one thing, and it reads it
off the folder name.

```

```

**One folder per participant, and the folder name is the participant ID.** That
is the whole of what you tell the script; everything else it works out from the
transcripts inside. `raw/P01/` becomes `anonymized/P01/`, and `P01` is what
replaces that person's name wherever it appears. Sub-folders are walked and the
shape is preserved, so whatever Zoom handed you can go in as it came — the tool
reads those `GMT…` timestamps to lay [interrupted
sessions](#interrupted-sessions) end to end.

**The pass replaces speaker names, and nothing else.** In the attribution, in
the body of the transcript, and in filenames. Places, employers, job titles and
anyone mentioned who never speaks all survive untouched, on purpose — this is a
first sweep over transcripts you are going to read anyway, not a
de-identification pass, and it does not make a transcript safe to hand on
unread. Whatever it could not resolve is printed under **REVIEW**, which is the
part to actually read. There is more on what it refuses and what it only reports
in [Anonymizing a set of interviews](#anonymizing-a-set-of-interviews).

**Keep the two trees apart.** The script never writes into its input, and
refuses to write into an output folder that already holds files unless you pass
`--force`. Point the reader at `anonymized/` and the real names stay in one
directory you can delete when the study is over.

The reader will happily open `raw/` — a folder holding a transcript *is* a
recording, and a folder of those is a library — so nothing stops you reading the
un-anonymized copy. Which is the point of keeping them in separate trees with
different names.

## Dependencies

Tiered, so the part you use daily has the fewest ways to break:

| | |
|---|---|
| core | `fastapi`, `uvicorn`, `rapidfuzz` — reading, correcting, quoting |
| `analysis` | `numpy`, `scikit-learn` — the map, graph and signals |
| `neural` | `sentence-transformers` — paraphrase-aware similarity |
| `align` | `torch`, `transformers` — [measured word timings](#word-timings) |
| `dev` | `pytest`, `httpx` |

```bash
uv sync --all-extras                          # everything
pip install -e '.[analysis,neural,align]'     # the pip equivalent
```

`align` also wants `ffmpeg` on `PATH`, which is not a Python package and so cannot
be pinned in the lockfile.

The extras are genuinely optional: `semantics.py` and `alignment.py` import their
heavy dependencies *inside* their functions, so the app starts, the reader and
library work, and only the features that need them return a 503 that names the
fix. Every rung degrades to the one below — UMAP to t-SNE to PCA, the language
model to word overlap, measured timings to interpolated ones.

Every requirement carries an upper bound, and `uv.lock` pins the resolved graph
of all 80 packages. This matters more than install size for a tool meant to open
a study years after it was recorded: without a ceiling, a future scikit-learn
that changed a clustering default would quietly reshuffle your map.

## What it expects

A folder with at least one `.vtt` transcript and its media. Video is preferred
(`.mp4`, `.m4v`, `.mov`, `.webm`, `.mkv`) with audio as a fallback (`.m4a`,
`.mp3`, `.wav`, …) — a typical Zoom folder with both an `.mp4` and an `.m4a`
uses the `.mp4`.

**Everything in the folder is one session.** Zoom splits a meeting into several
recordings when it gets interrupted, and each part restarts its transcript at
00:00. The folder's files are grouped into parts, ordered, and laid end to end on
a single continuous timeline.

## Interrupted sessions

Part two starts where part one's *recording* ended — not where its last caption
ended, since a recording usually runs on past the final word. Durations are read
straight out of the MP4/M4A container, so this needs no ffprobe; if a part's
media is missing, its last caption plus a short tail is used instead.

```
part 1   0:00:00 ──────────────── 1:30:00
         [ 10 min interruption, shown as a marker ]
part 2   1:30:00 ──────────────── 2:15:00
```

Times never restart, and the timeline has **no holes** — every session timestamp
has audio behind it, so scrubbing anywhere lands on something. The real
interruption is shown where it happened, as a rule across the reading column
reading *"Recording resumed after 10 minutes · 2:12 PM"*. Playback crosses the
seam by itself: playing off the end of one recording continues into the next, and
seeking or jumping to a quote switches files transparently.

Blocks never merge across a break, even when the same person is still talking.

Parts are ordered by the GMT timestamp Zoom stamps into cloud filenames
(`GMT20240301-140000_Recording.transcript.vtt`), which also pairs each transcript
with its media. Failing that, transcripts and media are paired on a shared stem
once Zoom's decoration is stripped, then by trailing counter and modified time.
Wall-clock interruption lengths need the filename timestamps; without them the
marker says which part is starting but not how long the gap was.

## Your recordings stay put

The rule is about your data, not about your dependencies. **Nothing from a
recording — audio, transcript, quotes, notes, tags — is ever sent anywhere.** The
server binds to `127.0.0.1` only, and the page has no CDN assets, web fonts, or
analytics, so it is drawn entirely with fonts already on your machine and nothing
about what you are reading is observable off it.

Downloads in the other direction are fine and are a normal install step: the
`neural` similarity backend fetches a sentence-transformer model once, then runs
it in this process. Inbound and local — the model comes to the quotes, never the
other way round.

## Reading

The transcript is grouped into blocks: contiguous captions from one speaker read
as a single passage, with paragraph breaks inserted where the speaker paused for
more than a couple of seconds. Underneath, every original caption is kept
separately — that is what lets an arbitrary text selection resolve to a point in
the recording.

Blocks hang off a **time spine** down the left, with timestamps as ticks. The
marker on the spine shows where you are.

Playback speed sits in the transport bar, from 0.5x for a mumbled passage up to
2x for a stretch you already know. Pitch correction is on, so a voice at 1.5x
still sounds like that person rather than a cartoon — tone is half of why the
recording is here. The speed is remembered between sessions, survives crossing
from one recording into the next, and the themes page plays quotes at it too.

The video pane starts minimized and stays that way between sessions. Expanded, it
can be resized by dragging the grip along its top edge — or by focusing the grip
and using the arrow keys. The height is remembered, and capped at three quarters
of the window so the transcript can never be squeezed out.

### Two modes

Reading is the default:

- **Reading** — the cursor follows where you are in the text, and the player is
  silently cued to match. Press play and it starts where you are looking.
- **Following** — starting playback switches here: the transcript keeps up with
  the audio and scrolls itself.

Scrolling or moving the cursor by hand drops back to Reading **without stopping
playback**, and a "Follow along" button appears to re-attach.

### Keys

| | |
|---|---|
| `j` / `k` | previous / next block |
| `Space` | play / pause |
| `←` / `→` | seek ∓5s |
| `/` | search |
| `e` | correct the current block |
| `h` | save the selection as a quote |
| `c` | copy the selection with speaker and timestamp |
| `f` | toggle following |
| `[` / `]` | slower / faster |
| `s` | break this block into its captions |
| double-click | cut the caption in front of that word |
| `1`…`9` | assign this block to a speaker, then move on |
| `Esc` | clear selection |
| `i` / `o` | start / end a [video code](#video-codes) at the playhead |
| `x` | delete the video code under the playhead |

## Correcting the transcript

Press `e` on a block to fix what the transcript got wrong. Reading shows merged
prose, but a correction has to land on a single caption, since that is what gets
written back — so edit mode opens the block into the captions underneath it, each
with its own timestamp and a button to replay just that line. Caption boundaries
become visible exactly when they matter and stay invisible the rest of the time.

Enter saves a line and moves to the next; Esc abandons the line you are on and
finishes. Focusing a line cues the player to it without interrupting playback, so
you can correct while listening.

### Cutting a caption in two

Zoom's worst habit is putting the end of one person's turn and the start of the
next inside a *single* caption — `So walk me through it. Sure, I read it first.`
No amount of reattributing captions separates those, because they are one
caption. So the caption itself has to divide first.

**Double-click the first word of the second turn.** That word begins the new
caption, the cursor lands on it, and a speaker key names it — so `1 2 1 2` carries
on without ever leaving the reading view. Pointing inside a word cuts in front of
that whole word rather than mid-word, and pointing at the space between two words
counts as pointing at the one after it. The reading column shows an I-beam, since
the prose is there to be pointed at and selected rather than clicked.

The same cut is available on the caret in edit mode, with **⌘⏎** (`Ctrl+Enter`) —
useful when you are already correcting the words and can see the caption
boundaries. Double-click means *select a word* while editing, as it should.

The boundary comes from the audio. Splitting first measures that caption's words,
so the cut lands in the real silence between the two speakers: the first half ends
on its last word, the second begins on its first, and the pause between them
belongs to neither — which is more accurate than Zoom's own abutting captions. If
alignment is unavailable the two halves share one interpolated boundary instead,
and the toast says which of the two you got. Both halves keep the speaker label,
so the file still re-parses as it did. The cut point travels with the text it was
measured against, so it lands between the same two words even if the line has
unsaved typing in it.

The toast that reports a cut carries an **Undo**, since the moment after cutting
is when you find out you did not mean it. It puts the two halves back and restores
the transcript byte for byte. Undo carries the two halves *as written*, so if
anything else moved the captions in between it refuses rather than joining
whichever two now hold those numbers.

### Handing a passage to whoever said it

The commonest version of this problem while *reading* rather than editing: half of
what Zoom filed under one person was plainly said by the other, and you can see
exactly which words.

Select them. The quote bar that appears offers **said by** and the speakers it
knows about — the roster first, then anyone else the transcript names — and picking
one hands those words over. Whatever captions have to be cut for the passage to be
its own are cut, which is usually one caption into three: what came before, the
passage, and what came after. Only the speakers the passage is *not* already
credited to are offered, since handing it to whoever has it does nothing.

A selection that starts or ends mid-word takes the whole word with it, because a
caption boundary inside a word leaves two fragments. The cuts are measured cuts
like any other, so the new caption starts on its first word rather than in the
tail of somebody else's sentence.

The speakers on offer come from the roster and the transcript's own labels, so a
transcript with neither has nothing to offer yet — name someone with **+ Speaker**
in the strip under the header first.

**Quotes are recredited, not just re-anchored.** A quote inside the passage follows
its words *and* changes hands, because a quote stores who said it and that is what
gets copied out and read months later. A misattributed quote is the one error here
that could end up in something published, so reattributing captions carries through
to every quote anchored in them — including from the speaker field in edit mode and
the speaker keys, which had been leaving quotes crediting the wrong person.

### Joining captions back together

Zoom's opposite failure is chopping one sentence across three captions, so a quote
that reads as a single thought is three anchors underneath.

In edit mode, **⌫ at the start of a line joins it to the line above** — what
backspace means in every text editor, applied to captions. The joined caption runs
from the first one's start to the last one's end, and the words are joined in
order.

One caption carries one speaker, so joining across two of them keeps the first
label and drops the other. That is said out loud in a warning rather than left to
be discovered, because it is usually a sign the join was not what you wanted.

Joining is how Undo works, and both go through the same request. Quotes follow
their words: a quote inside an absorbed caption moves to where those words now sit,
one spanning the whole run collapses into the single caption, and ids after it shift
back. **Measured word timings need no attention at all** — joining leaves the
recording's sequence of words identical, so every measurement still describes the
same word, exactly as with a split.

Splitting and joining are the two edits that change the *number* of captions,
which renumbers every caption after them. Quotes are re-anchored across that
shift rather than left pointing at their old numbers: a quote after a cut follows
its caption, and a quote inside the split one lands in whichever half now holds
its words — including one that straddles the cut, which ends up spanning both.

## Word timings

Zoom times a caption's *edges* honestly and tells you nothing about its interior.
Ask where the word `Sure` is, thirty characters into a ten-second caption, and the
answer is a proportion of the way through — which is wrong by roughly the length
of whatever pause the speaker took. In interview audio that is regularly a second
or more, and it is worst exactly where you care: the handover between two people.

**Measure word timings** in the strip under the header fixes that. It aligns the
transcript to the audio and stores where every word actually falls, after which a
quote's timestamp is a measurement rather than an estimate. Measured blocks are
marked: their timestamp is underlined, so you can tell which kind of number you
are looking at without having to ask.

This is *forced alignment*, not re-transcription — an important difference. The
words are an **input**: they come from the transcript, Zoom's plus your
corrections, and only timing comes back. Nothing in the process can change a word,
which is why it is safe to run on a folder you have already been quoting from. A
re-transcription pass would return a different set of words and strand every quote
anchored into the old ones.

It runs on **demand and in batches**, never automatically. The button walks the
session a couple of dozen captions at a time so there is progress to watch and a
Stop that keeps everything measured so far. Splitting a caption measures that one
caption first, on its own, because a cut is where a guess does the most lasting
damage — it becomes a timestamp in the file that outlives the decision.

Timings live in `session.words.json` beside the recording, never in the VTT, so
the transcript stays the file Zoom wrote plus your corrections and a folder
without that file behaves exactly as it always did.

Each word is addressed by its position in the recording's word sequence rather
than by caption, which is what makes measuring one caption at a time safe:
splitting a caption in two leaves the sequence of words *identical*, so every
timing stays valid with nothing to remap. Rewording a caption does change the
sequence, so those timings shift — and because every stored timing carries the
word it was measured against, a desync is caught on load and falls back to
interpolation instead of quietly reporting the wrong second of audio.

**What it needs and what it costs.** `ffmpeg` on `PATH`, the `align` extra, and a
one-time ~360MB model download. After that, roughly 0.2s per caption on a laptop
CPU, so a one-hour interview is a minute or two — and the audio is read locally
and never sent anywhere. Where two people talk over each other it will place words
confidently in the wrong gap, and words it has no letters for (`2024`, `50%`) get
no timing and are interpolated across. Anything unmeasured simply behaves as it
did before, caption by caption.

**The original is preserved.** Before the first change to a transcript, it is
copied to `<name>_original.vtt`. That copy is written once and never touched
again, so it always holds the file as it came off Zoom regardless of how many
corrections follow. Backups are skipped by folder discovery, so they never get
read as another recording.

**Edits are spliced, not regenerated.** Only the edited caption's text is
replaced; every other byte stays as it was, including line endings and any block
the parser could not read. Rebuilding the file from parsed data would silently
drop those, and a transcript is the wrong place to lose things quietly.

**Quotes follow their words.** Correcting a line re-anchors every quote
overlapping it, so a quote keeps covering the same words rather than drifting by
however many characters you inserted. The quote's saved text is refreshed too, so
it reflects the correction instead of preserving the error.

Timestamps are not editable, but **who said a line is**. Zoom segments badly: a
trailing clause routinely lands under whoever spoke before it. In edit mode each
line carries a speaker field alongside its words, so the fix is to say who
actually said it.

The name is written into the transcript as a normal label *and* into a
`NOTE speakers:` roster at the top of the file. Detection has to stay
conservative — it would never accept a one-word name on a single line — but an
assignment is a decision, not a guess, so the roster makes it survive re-parsing.
It is standard WebVTT, ignored by anything that plays the file.

## Recordings made in a room

An in-person session recorded through one laptop comes back with the whole room
filed under whoever started the meeting. One speaker label carrying several
people is worse than none, so:

- **a transcript with exactly one speaker is never joined** — every caption
  stands alone, because joining on that label would invent a monologue out of a
  conversation
- **joining resumes the moment a second speaker exists**, so blocks reform as you
  assign them
- **the anonymizer labels a lone speaker `unknown`** rather than the participant
  ID, since the label identifies nobody in particular

A transcript with *no* speaker labels at all is a different situation and still
breaks on long pauses, which at least reads.

### Labelling with the keyboard

Name the speakers in the strip under the header — **+ Speaker** — and each one
gets a key. Rename with ✎, remove with ✕. Nothing here needs the transcript
opened; the roster is stored in it as a standard `NOTE speakers:` line, but that
is a storage detail rather than somewhere to type.

Where a transcript already names several speakers, they are offered as one-click
adds so they only need keys. Where it names exactly one, they are not: that label
is the room rather than a person, and rostering it would let its lines join and
defeat labelling them apart.

Digits by default — nothing else in the reader uses them, and `1`–`5` fall under
the hand that is not on the trackpad. Any single character works if you would
rather: `q=Note taker`. A bare name gets the next free digit, so the shorthand
`NOTE speakers: Interviewer, Participant` is enough.

The keys are shown in a strip under the header, so the bindings are never
something to remember. Pressing one assigns the block at the cursor and moves to
the next, which makes a labelling pass a run of keypresses: `1 2 1 2` down the
transcript.

When a block holds more than one person — Zoom routinely files a trailing
comment under whoever spoke before it — `s` breaks it into its captions so each
can be assigned separately, and `1 2 1 2` carries on. Splitting writes nothing:
it only exposes the seams, and the assignment is what persists. The keys need a
roster, so a transcript with no `NOTE speakers:` line has nothing to press.

When two people share a *single* caption, exposing the seams is not enough —
there is no seam. That case needs the caption cut, which is
[⌘⏎ in edit mode](#cutting-a-caption-in-two).

Once anyone is on the roster, **joining follows assignment**: only rostered
speakers merge, and whatever label the transcript arrived with stays line by
line. Without that, the first assignment would collapse every unlabelled line
after it into one block and the next keypress would relabel all of them at once.
A transcript with no roster joins exactly as it always did.

## Quotes

Select any text — across caption or speaker boundaries — and a bar appears
showing the estimated timestamp. Pick a color to save it. The new quote is
scrolled into view in the Quotes sidebar and briefly marked, and its inline
highlight is marked too, so the transcript and the list agree on which one you
just made. Keyboard focus stays in the transcript unless you chose "Save with
note", so `j` keeps moving you down the page rather than typing into a field.

Notes and tags are edited in the sidebar. The tag filter lists only tags that
have quotes behind them, with a count — a tag you have stopped using disappears
from the filter, while remaining available for autocomplete when tagging.

Everything is written immediately to one `session.highlights.json` beside the
recording — one file per folder, whatever the number of parts — so quotes travel
with the folder. There is no save step. Writes are atomic, so an interrupted
write cannot truncate the file.

Quotes saved by an earlier version, in a file named after the transcript, are
adopted into the session file on first open. The original is left on disk
untouched as a backup, never deleted.

Timestamps come from where your selection falls inside a caption rather than
snapping to the caption's start — on Zoom's longer captions that is a difference
of several seconds. By default that position is interpolated, which is a guess;
[measuring the word timings](#word-timings) replaces it with the real thing.
Playback seeks 0.75s early either way, so the first word is not clipped.

## Video codes

Quotes code what was *said*. Video codes code what *happened* — `scroll` from
1:02 to 1:30, `hesitates` over a button — as spans of the recording's time rather
than of its words.

**They are separate from quote tags, entirely.** Their own list, their own files,
their own place on screen. A video code and a tag can share a name without having
anything to do with each other, and neither suggests the other's entries while you
type. The UI always says "video code", never just "code", so the two never blur.

**Marking.** Press `i` where something starts and `o` where it ends — both at the
playhead, so it works while watching. A pulsing tick on the scrub bar shows an open
start. `o` pauses playback and opens a picker over the dock listing the video codebook; the span ends where you pressed `o`, however long choosing takes. Type to narrow
it, `Enter` to choose, or type a new name to add it. `Esc` in the picker keeps the
start open, `Esc` elsewhere drops it. A code can carry its own key: with a start
open, that key ends the span and codes it in one press. `x` deletes the span under
the playhead, with an Undo.

**Where they show.** Never on the words — that is where quotes live.

- **Over the scrub bar**, a lane of coloured bars on the same scale as the bar
  itself, overlapping spans stacked. Click a bar to go there; drag either end to
  move that end.
- **Down the time spine**, a thin band per span beside the blocks it covers.
  Clicking one seeks there and opens it in the sidebar.
- **The Video codes tab**, listing every span with its code, times and length,
  a note, and a menu to recode it. Chips filter by code. Whatever is under the
  playhead is marked in all three as it plays.

**Beside the transcript.** With **Codes beside text** on (the default; the
choice is remembered), each span is also listed in a column right of the text:
its start time, code and length, set at the height of that moment in the
transcript so it lines up with the block timestamps. Entries that would collide
are nudged down rather than reordered. Turning it off hides both the column and
the spine bands, leaving the text alone. The column needs a wide window and
hides below about 60rem, like the spine.

**Coding without the transcript.** **▶ Code video** in the reader opens `/code`,
a view with just the video, filling the window, and the Video codes panel. It
uses the same keys (`i`, `o`, `x`, `Space`, `←`/`→`, `[`/`]`), adds `,`/`.` for
one-second steps, and has a **mute** button (`m`, remembered) for coding what is
on screen rather than what is said. It reads and writes the same files as the
reader, and each page re-reads them when it regains focus, so the two can be
open side by side.

**The codebook** is shared across the library, so a study codes consistently.
*Manage video codes* in the tab renames, recolours, sets keys and describes what
counts as each code. Spans refer to a code by id, so a rename is one edit that
every span in every recording follows. A code nothing uses can be deleted; one in
use has to be **merged** into another instead, which moves its spans first — a
code cannot disappear out from under data. Keys the reader and the coding view already use (`j`, `k`,
`h`, `i`, `o`, `m`, digits, …) and speaker keys cannot be code keys.

**Storage.** The codebook is `library.video_codebook.json` at the library root
(the recording folder itself when only one is open). Spans are
`session.video_codes.json` beside each recording, in session seconds — the same
continuous timeline as quotes, so a span can cross an interruption. Neither file
depends on the transcript, so correcting a caption never moves a video code. Both
are written atomically and moved aside to `.corrupt` rather than overwritten if
they cannot be read, like every other file here.

## Finding quotes

Exact matches rank first, then close ones (for when the transcript did not hear
the word the way you remember it). Matching runs across block text, so a phrase
split across two captions is still findable. `.*` switches to regex.

## Checking the parse

Speaker detection is a heuristic. Zoom writes the speaker either as a
`Name:` prefix inside the caption or as a `<v Name>` tag; the prefix form is
ambiguous, because a sentence like *"So here's my point: I disagreed"* looks
identical to one. Candidate prefixes are therefore collected across the whole
file and only promoted to speakers if they read as a proper name or recur, so a
stray mid-sentence colon cannot invent a speaker.

The app reports what it decided in a banner on first open. To check a folder
without starting the server:

```bash
subtitle-search --dump-parse /path/to/recording-folder
```

It prints the speakers and cue counts, plus the part layout — which recording
starts at which session time, how long each runs, and how long each interruption
was. A wrong order or a wrong duration silently shifts every timestamp after it,
so that layout is the thing worth checking on real files.

## Other flags

```
--port N      default 8765
--host ADDR   default 127.0.0.1
--no-open     do not open a browser
--reload      restart when the Python source changes
```

### Working on the tool

`--reload` restarts the server whenever a `.py` file in the package changes, so a
backend change is live in about a second instead of after remembering to restart —
which is the sort of thing you only remember after debugging the old code for a
while.

```bash
uv run subtitle-search ~/study/P01 --reload
```

It logs each reload, deliberately: a reload you cannot see happening is worse than
none. The browser tab is opened once by the parent process, so a reload does not
keep opening new ones.

**Only this package is watched.** Your recording folder is not, on purpose —
quotes and word timings are written into it constantly, and saving a quote should
not restart the server that just saved it. Frontend files need no reload at all:
the HTML, CSS and JS are read from disk per request, so a browser refresh is
enough.

Reloading re-imports the app in a fresh process, which means it cannot be handed
an app that is already built. The folder therefore travels in
`SUBTITLE_SEARCH_FOLDER` and the child process builds its own registry from it —
so every reload also re-reads the folder, and a transcript corrected outside the
tool shows up. `watchfiles` in the `dev` extra makes the watching event-based;
without it uvicorn polls instead and reload still works.

## A library of recordings

Point it at a folder of recording folders and it opens as a library instead of a
single reader:

```bash
subtitle-search ~/study/            # a folder of participant folders
subtitle-search ~/study/P01/        # a single recording
```

Either way the home page is the library, and a recording opens from there. One
entry point beats a home page that changes shape depending on how many folders it
found.

There is nothing to configure: a folder holding a transcript *is* a recording, so
a folder that holds none is read as a library of the folders beneath it (two
levels deep, which is how these arrive). A folder whose transcript cannot be
parsed is reported and skipped rather than taking the whole library down.

The library lists every recording with its duration, speakers, quote count and
tags, and searches every transcript at once. Results link straight to the moment
in the reader.

## Sharing a study through Google Drive

The tool itself never sends anything anywhere. But everything it saves is a plain
file in the recording folder, so if that folder is synced by **Google Drive for
desktop**, the sync client uploads each save and a collaborator sees it. Each
person runs this fork on their own machine, pointed at their synced copy of the
same study folder. There is no server to host.

**Check your approvals first.** Syncing puts the recordings and transcripts on
Google's servers. Make sure your IRB protocol or data management plan allows
that, and use the Google account it covers (usually the institutional one). If
Drive is not allowed, the steps are the same for any synced folder that is,
such as Box.

### One-time setup, for each person

1. **Install this fork.**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/shaily99/interview-analysis.git
   cd interview-analysis
   uv sync
   ```

   Later, `git pull` picks up changes to the fork.

2. **Install Google Drive for desktop.** Download it from
   <https://www.google.com/drive/download/> or run `brew install --cask google-drive`,
   then sign in. On Apple silicon Macs, approve the system extension under
   **System Settings → Privacy & Security** if asked.

3. **Get the study folder.** The owner shares the study folder (for example
   `pilots/`) with each collaborator, with **Editor** access. A collaborator who
   has it under *Shared with me* adds it to their own drive with
   **Organize → Add shortcut → My Drive** in the web view, so it appears on
   disk.

4. **Keep it on disk.** In Finder, right-click the study folder and choose
   **Available offline**. By default Drive streams files on demand, which is fine
   for small JSON files but not for scrubbing through an 80 MB video.

### Folder layout

The study folder is the library: one folder per participant, with the shared
codebook next to them.

```
pilots/                           ← point the tool here
  library.video_codebook.json     ← the video code list, shared by every recording
  library.themes.json             ← themes, if you use /themes
  P'1/
    GMT…_Recording.mp4
    GMT…_Recording.transcript.vtt ← each folder needs a .vtt to open
  P'2/
    …
    session.highlights.json       ← quotes
    session.video_codes.json      ← video code spans
    session.words.json            ← measured word timings
    audio…_original.vtt           ← backup written on the first correction
```

Folders without a `.vtt` are skipped, and Google Docs shortcuts (`.gdoc`) are
ignored. When you move a recording in, bring its `session.*.json` files and
`_original.vtt` with it, and keep `library.video_codebook.json` at the top of
the study folder. Spans refer to codes by id, so a span whose codebook stayed
behind shows as *unknown code*.

### Running it

Drive mounts under `~/Library/CloudStorage/`. Quote the path, because it has
spaces and participant folders often have apostrophes:

```bash
uv run subtitle-search "$HOME/Library/CloudStorage/GoogleDrive-<you@example.edu>/My Drive/<path>/pilots"
```

Point it at the **study folder**, not a participant folder. Opened on its own, a
participant folder gets its own codebook, which nobody else's recordings see.

The tool reads the folder when it starts. To see what a collaborator saved,
wait for Drive to finish syncing (the menu-bar icon), then restart the tool with
Ctrl+C and the command again. In the reader and the coding view, switching back
to the tab also re-reads the video codes.

### Taking turns

Right now two people cannot safely work on the **same recording at the same
time**. Every quote, correction and video code for a recording lives in shared
files, and Drive does not merge JSON. If two saves cross, one person's changes
are lost, or Drive keeps both versions as a duplicate file (for example
`session.video_codes (1).json`) that the tool does not read. Editing the
codebook while someone else does has the same risk.

Until per-coder files exist (see [Not built yet](#not-built-yet)):

- Split the work by recording: each person codes different participant folders.
- Before starting a recording, let Drive finish syncing. When done, keep the
  tool running for a few seconds so the last save uploads.
- If a file like `… (1).json` appears, the two versions conflicted. Compare them
  by hand before deleting either one.

## Themes: analysis across recordings

`/themes` works on every quote in the library at once, in several views. They
exist because the work has several shapes, and no single layout serves all of
them. The canvas and the board are two shapes of the *same* grouping — a theme
made on either appears on the other, because there is one file underneath.

### Canvas — affinity diagramming on a plane

Quotes as post-its on a surface that pans and zooms. Areas are themes; cards are
quotes; where things sit is up to you.

The board it replaces ran out of screen. Columns only work while they all fit,
and past about six themes the useful ones are off the right-hand edge — which is
the point at which the layout starts deciding what you think about. A plane has
no right-hand edge.

What the plane also gets you is what a column list cannot express at all. Two
areas nudged up against each other is a claim you are making about them. An
outlier parked on bare canvas between two areas is a quote you have not decided
about. None of that is a field in the file; it is the arrangement, and the
arrangement is the analysis.

- **New area** makes a theme, in the middle of what you are looking at.
- Drag quotes out of the **tray** on the left — same side as the board's
  unsorted column — onto the plane. A study has hundreds of quotes, so they wait
  in a list rather than being scattered across the surface on first open. A
  quote leaves the list once it has a card anywhere.

  Tray quotes are shown **whole**, never cut off, and each carries a **↗** to
  where it was said. Deciding which theme a quote belongs to means reading it,
  and a truncated list makes you drag each one out to find out what it says —
  which is the decision, done backwards.
- Drag an area **by the strip across the top of its title bar** and its quotes
  travel with it. Card positions are stored relative to their area, so this is
  two numbers changing and nothing can be left behind. The strip exists because
  the bar is otherwise almost all controls — the title is a field, the note is a
  field, the rest are buttons — which left the padding between them as the only
  place to take hold of, and that is a knack rather than a handle. Like the rest
  of the bar it does not scale, so it is the same easy target at any zoom.
- **Resize** from the bottom-right corner. Cards a smaller box no longer covers
  are pulled back inside rather than evicted — a quote does not stop being part
  of a theme because you dragged the box in.
- **▾ rolls an area up** to its title, note and count, keeping its size and
  everything in it. A study's themes are not all live at once, and a finished one
  taking a screenful of plane is a finished one in the way. Quotes can still be
  dropped on a rolled-up area — the theme is closed, not shut — and **Roll up
  all** does the lot, for seeing the shape of the whole study at once.
- **⊞ tidy** packs one area's cards by speaker and then time *and writes it*,
  for when free placement has become a pile you no longer want.
- Drag a card **back to the tray** to put it away. Only that card: other copies
  of the same quote stay where they are.
- Drop a card on **bare canvas** to park it. It counts as dealt with — it leaves
  the tray — without being filed in any theme.
- **✕** deletes an area and offers an undo that restores the box, the note and
  the arrangement inside it. The quotes were never at risk: they live in the
  recordings, and without an area they simply return to the tray.

### Theme names do not shrink

Everything on the plane scales with the zoom except an area's title bar, which
stays the size it would be in a sidebar. A quote shrinking as you pull back is
fine — you are not reading it from there. A theme's *name* is what you navigate
by, and a plane whose labels go illegible exactly when you zoom out to see all of
them has given up the thing it was for.

Holding that costs the bar some room, so it gives up its parts in order: the note
and the recording spread go first, then the count, and last of all — only on a
bar too narrow to press anything — the ▶ ⊞ ✕ buttons. The name keeps the width.
A long name wraps rather than being cut off, and only shrinks — never below 9px —
when a single word is wider than the whole area, which happens below about a
quarter zoom. Zoomed out far enough, an area becomes a labelled tile, which is
the right thing to be at a zoom where no quote is readable.

### Grid, which changes nothing

**Grid** draws every area's cards packed into rows and **writes nothing**. Free
placement is the point of the plane, and it is also how an area ends up
unreadable; this is how to read it without giving up the arrangement that made it
unreadable. Turning it off puts everything back exactly where it was.

It packs **by speaker, then by time**, which is the other half of what it is for.
An area laid out that way is one voice at a time in the order it was said: the
same person's three remarks about trust sit together, and the place where
somebody else takes over is visible. A quote nobody is credited with sorts last,
because those are the ones to fix rather than the ones to read first.

`⊞ tidy` writes exactly that order, so grid view doubles as a preview of what
tidying an area would commit — and because the order comes from the quotes and
not from where they were dragged, tidying twice changes nothing.

While grid view is on, a drag inside one area does nothing — there is nowhere to
put anything — but dragging *between* areas still moves a card, and lands it in a
clear slot.

Speakers group across recordings, so if the same name interviews in all of them
their quotes gather under it rather than staying with their sessions.

### Filters

Sorting a pile of three hundred quotes is not one job. It is "everything Priya
said about trust", then "the untagged remainder", then "the three long ones I
keep putting off" — and without a way to ask for those, the tray is a scroll bar.
So the list narrows by **text** (across the quote, its note, its tags and its
speaker), **tag** (a named one, or anything tagged at all, or nothing tagged),
**speaker**, **recording**, **highlight colour**, and **whether it carries a
note**; and it orders by recording, by length, or by how many tags a quote has.
Every dimension is an "and": the point of having six is to arrive at a handful.

Filtering also marks the matching cards *already on the plane*, quieting the
rest. Nothing is hidden and nothing moves — a filter is a question, and hiding a
card would answer one nobody asked. It tells you the thing the list cannot: where
the quotes you are asking about have already ended up.

**The same quote can be pinned in two areas.** A card is one *appearance* of a
quote, not the quote itself, so alt-drag (or **Also place in…**) leaves the
original where it is and puts a second card elsewhere — photocopying a post-it to
pin it to two walls. On the board those show as one quote in two columns, each
card saying where else it appears.

Every **↗** — on a tray quote, on a card, on the board, in the matrix — opens
the transcript in a **new tab**. Following it in place would throw away the pan,
the zoom, the selection and a half-narrowed filter to answer a question that is
usually "wait, what came before this?". The point of checking the context is to
come back with it.

Without a mouse: tab to a quote in the tray and press enter to put it on the
plane; tab to a card and the panel under the tray moves it between themes, arrow
keys nudge it (shift for fine), delete puts it away. Drag the background to pan,
ctrl- or ⌘-scroll to zoom, `0` to frame everything.

Which areas are rolled up lives in the study's file, because it is a statement
about the work. The zoom, the pan and whether grid view is on stay in the
browser: those are about you at this moment, not about the analysis.

A themes file written before the canvas existed has no coordinates in it. The
first open lays those themes out in a grid and packs each one's quotes inside,
rather than opening empty and asking for sorting you already did.

### Board — columns, for when there are few enough to see

The same themes as columns, which is the right shape until there are more themes
than fit across the screen. Drag is the fast path; every card also has a menu, so
the board works without a mouse.

The board's move is one theme at a time: choosing a theme there takes the quote
out of the others. The canvas is where a quote goes into two themes at once,
because there you can see that it did.

Each column shows how many recordings it draws on, which is the difference
between a theme and one person's preoccupation. The filter narrows the board to
unsorted, tagged, or untagged quotes so you can work through a pile rather than
stare at all of it.

### Matrix — for when they do

Tags down the side, recordings across the top, counts in the cells. Rows are
sorted by how many recordings share the tag, so the findings float to the top and
the singletons sink. Cell weight is ink, not a colour ramp, so a row reads at a
glance without matching swatches to a legend.

Click a tag for every quote carrying it; click a cell for one participant's.

### Pairs — for when the codebook has drifted

Tags that share a quote, strongest first. Two codes that always arrive together
are usually one code wearing two names, or a cause and its effect. It is the
cheapest signal that a codebook needs consolidating.

### Map — for arguing with your codebook

```bash
pip install -e '.[analysis]'          # the map, graph and signals
pip install -e '.[analysis,neural]'   # + understands paraphrase
```

Every quote placed by what it *says*, not by what you tagged it. The clusters
here are formed by the language, so they can disagree with your themes — and
where they do is either a theme you missed or a distinction you decided not to
make. Drag a loop around a group to turn it into a theme.

Colour by your themes, by the clusters the language forms, or by recording.
Click any point for the quote and its nearest neighbours in meaning, and click
through those to walk the corpus by similarity rather than by tag.

Two backends. **Word overlap** is the default: instant, local, no download, and
honestly limited — it cannot tell that *"it never works"* and *"constantly
broken"* are the same complaint. The **language model** can, and the difference
is stark; on the same pair of quotes about consent and cloud storage, word
overlap scores `0.00` and the model scores `0.34`.

The model is the one thing in this tool that touches the network: it downloads
once, then lives on your machine, and vectors are cached in
`library.embeddings.npz` so it is paid for once. **Your quotes are never sent
anywhere** — encoding happens in this process.

### Graph — the shape of the codebook

Tags as a network, pulled together by the quotes they share. The same numbers as
Pairs, arranged so you can see what clumps, what dangles off the side, and what
sits on its own.

### Signals — is the study finished?

The grounded-theory question, drawn as the curve it actually is: cumulative
distinct tags against interviews, in the order they were recorded. A curve still
climbing at the last participant is the study saying it is not done. It measures
the codebook rather than the world, so a flat curve can equally mean you stopped
noticing — worth reading as a prompt, not a verdict.

Underneath: the quotes least like anything else. Negative cases are where a
theme's real boundary is, and they are the easiest thing to lose because nothing
groups them.

**Nothing here files anything.** Every cluster and every ranking is a proposal;
a person accepts it or does not.

### Listening to a theme

Any theme, tag, or cell can be played straight through: each quote in turn, in
the recording it came from, stopping at its own end. Tone is half of what a quote
means and it does not survive being written down — being able to hear a theme
rather than only read it is the reason the recordings are still attached.

Themes are stored in `library.themes.json` at the root of the library, beside the
recording folders rather than inside any one of them. A theme holds references,
never copies, so correcting a transcript updates every theme that quote appears
in, and deleting a quote in the reader removes it from its theme rather than
leaving a hole.

## Anonymizing a set of interviews

`scripts/anonymize_zoom.py` takes a directory of downloaded Zoom folders and
writes anonymized copies. Each folder under the input path is one participant,
and **the folder's name is that participant's ID**.

```bash
python scripts/anonymize_zoom.py raw/ anonymized/ --dry-run   # look first
python scripts/anonymize_zoom.py raw/ anonymized/
```

Media is copied verbatim. Transcripts are rewritten with `Sireesh Gururaja` and
`Jordan Taylor` replaced by `interviewer`, and the participant replaced by the
folder name. Names found in *filenames* are replaced the same way.

Names come **only from speaker labels**. Nothing else is treated as a name, so
places, employers, and products survive untouched for a human pass to judge.
Replacement covers both the speaker attribution and the same names spoken in the
body of the transcript.

### Who gets which label

Every decision is made from one folder's own transcripts — nothing is inferred by
comparing folders — so a folder anonymizes the same way whether it runs alone or
alongside fifty others. Within a folder, speakers are labeled by the order they
first speak:

```
first speaker    -> interviewer 1
second speaker   -> the participant (the folder name)
third onwards    -> interviewer 2, interviewer 3, ...
```

That ordering assumes an interviewer opens. When it is wrong — the participant
spoke first, or a colleague joined before them — name the interviewers:

```bash
python scripts/anonymize_zoom.py raw/ anonymized/ --interviewer "Ada Lovelace"
```

Named speakers are interviewers wherever they fall, in every folder, and the
participant becomes the first speaker not named. Someone named but never speaking
is still replaced if they are mentioned aloud. Because labels are per-folder,
`interviewer 2` is not necessarily the same person across folders unless you name
them.

The dry run prints the mapping for every folder before anything is written, which
is the place to catch a folder where the order was guessed wrong.

### Leaving folders out

```bash
python scripts/anonymize_zoom.py raw/ anonymized/ --skip-single-speaker
```

A transcript with only one voice usually means the recording captured one side of
the call. The ordering rule would label that lone person the participant, which
is as likely to be the interviewer talking to themselves — so this leaves those
folders out entirely.

Labels are merged before counting, so a participant who rejoins as `Alex` after
being `Alex Chen` is one speaker, not two. An interrupted session is counted
across all its transcripts together, so a folder where each part has one speaker
but the parts differ is kept.

Excluding is not a failure: those folders are listed separately and the exit
status stays zero.

### What it refuses, and what it only reports

A folder produces **no output at all** rather than a partial result. Nothing is
written until every file in it has passed, so a refusal never leaves
half-anonymized files behind. A folder is refused when it has no transcript, when
its output folder already has files (use `--force`), or when every speaker was
named as an interviewer so no participant is left.

Everything else is reported under `REVIEW` and still written, since deciding it
needs a reader:

- a line that still looks like `Somebody: text` where `Somebody` was never
  detected as a speaker. Detection is deliberately conservative, so this catches
  both a faint name and an ordinary line like `Correction:`
- a first name that is also a common word

The exit status is non-zero if any folder was refused. Other folders still
process, so one bad folder does not stop the run.

### What never reaches the output

Chat logs, `_original.vtt` transcript backups, and any file type the script does
not specifically handle. Backups matter here: they hold the transcript as it
arrived, so copying one would reintroduce every name the pass just removed.
Everything skipped is reported by name, so nothing disappears quietly.

### Left for your pass

This is a first sweep over transcripts you are going to read anyway, not a
substitute for reading them.

Given names that are also ordinary words (`Mark`, `Summer`, `Rose`) are **not**
replaced when they appear alone, because doing so would corrupt normal sentences
— "please mark that down". The full name is still replaced, and the script prints
which single names it left behind so your own pass knows where to look.

Zoom display names are pulled apart before matching, so
`B.F. (Jim) Lightning, Brown U. USA` contributes `B.F. Lightning`, `Lightning`
and the nickname `Jim` as names to replace — but not `Brown` or `USA`, which are
affiliation and would otherwise be rewritten wherever those words appeared.
Pronoun tags like `(she/her)` are recognized as tags, not nicknames.

## Development

```bash
pip install -e '.[dev]'
pytest
```

Tests run against synthetic VTT fixtures in `tests/fixtures.py`, including the
mid-sentence-colon trap, CRLF endings, voice tags, speakerless transcripts, and
byte-exact HTTP Range serving.

## Not built yet

Multi-recording library search. The backend is already namespaced by recording
id with a registry, so adding it means writing a folder scanner and a fan-out
search — not restructuring.

Per-coder video codes for shared folders. Each coder enters their name, and their
spans go to their own `session.video_codes.<name>.json`, so two people never
write the same file. An **independent** mode shows only your own codes, for
coding blind. A **collaborative** mode shows everyone's, labelled by coder, with
other people's read-only. Changes on disk are picked up without a restart.
